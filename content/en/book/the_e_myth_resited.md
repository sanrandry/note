## Note and review

"The E-myth revisited" is a book for entrepreneurs. Gerber, the author, says that most people start a business in search of freedom and self-empowerment, but instead end up being slaves of their own business.</br>
Michael Gerber then teaches entrepreneurs how to build business that can run independently of the founders, allowing them to be free.</br>

### important

- Think systems and replicable results(like franchise).</br>
- Work ON the business, not in the business(hire others to do you work)</br>

### summary

The E-myth revisited is divided into three parts:

- The current state of American small businesses (chapters 1 to 6)
- At theoretical overview of how should be
- the practical steps to build an effective business machine that will be independent of you and eventually make you free and independent (chapters 10 to 18)

### Chapter 1: The entrepreneurial Myth

Michael Gerber says that many people who get business do so because they don't want a boss. And they believe that because they know what they're doing, then they know how to run their own business.

### Chapter 2 : Entrepreneur, Manager & Technician

Michael Gerber affirms mos small businesses fail because owners are technicians lacking and entrepreneur qualities.

#### Technician

the technician lives in the present and is all about doing the job. He starts a business because after getting tired of working for someone else.

#### Manager

The manager plans an organizes, he clings to the status quo and craves order.

#### Entrepreneur

The entrepreneur is the visionary living in the future and moving from idea to idea, often without setting up all the necessary process for the business to succeed in real life.

### chapter 3: Infancy, The technician phase

Most people who start a business are technicians. They know how to do the job and start a company doing what they've been doing before. The owner and the business are exactly the same.</br>
But if your business depends on you an do what you have always been doing before, you don't own a business, you won a job.

### chapter 4: Adolescence, getting some help

The moment a business start hiring, it's when the technician moves to the manager phase.</br>
The most common mistakes of early managers and often of manager in general is that of doing the work themselves instead of teaching and delegating..

### chapter 5: Beyond the comfort zone

when you start hiring it gets difficult for most people as they are for the first time outside their comfort zone and have to rely on other people.  
Some people shirk from it and, out of fear, they go back to being just by themselves. But implosion, and few businesses survive it.  
Grow slow if you need to grow slowly, but don't go back.

### chapter 6: Maturity and entrepreneurial perspective

business don't become great once the mature.  
Yes, you must go trough infancy and adolescence, but great business started great.  
It was all about building business, not doing business.  
Building business means putting in place replicable systems that produce results for the customers.  
And the secret to starting out a great business is to imagine the business, well-defined, as it should be once you are mature. The go back, map what is takes you to get there and start building that vision into reality.

### Chapter 7: The turn-key revolution

A great, self-reliant business is built on systems, not on people.

### Chapter 8: The franchise prototype

The franchise is the best model and mentality for small business to succeed.  
The franchise has its strongest point in the systems it develops.  
The franchise systems allow your business to become independent of you as the owner and founder.  
If you get stuck in your business as a technician you will always be a slave of your job.

### chapter 9: Working ON your business, not in it

Working on your business means starting putting in place all the systems that will make the business work no matter whether you are there or not. And no matter whether people leave or you hire new ones because the systems make it easy for everyone to do the work.  
The right questions you to ask yourself are:

- How can you get your business to work without you, you are free!
- How can you make your people independent of you.
- How can you build a business you can replicate a hundred times.
- How can you set your time to do what you love instead of what you have to.

### Chapter 10: The business development process

Quantify everything, and make sure you can easily take your business' pulse by knowing what the key metrics.  
Your business should be predictable, and to be predictable your employees should have no discretion on their job. Because if you depend on people, you get chaos and you can't replicate it a hundred times. And if that's the case, ultimately, you don't own the business.

### Chapter 11: The business development program

How do you build a replicable business? With the Business Development Program, consisting following steps:

- Primary aim
- Strategic objective
- Organizational strategy
- Management strategy
- People strategy
- Marketing strategy
- Systems strategy

### Chapter 12: your primary aim

What is your life goal?  
Because business is a part of it, but your primary goal should be bigger than the business itself. Once you know your primary aim, it allows you to bring business to life and life ito your business.

### Chapter 13: your strategic objective

your strategic objective tells you how does your business fit into your primary aim.  
What does the business have to do so that ca fulfill your life's primary aim?  
This is not a business plan, it's a life's plan.

### Chapter 14: Your organizational strategy

The organizational strategy ties back to working on the business rather than in the business.  
It means doing strategic work and then hiring technicians (as lowly skilled as possible) to do tactical work.  
Example:  
at the very beginning, you sell in the position of sales rep. But you start working right away on the sales rep position as a VP marketing by producing manuals and script for the technicians that will soon replace you.

### Chapter 15: your management strategy

A perfect management strategy is automated. A system where managers won't have to make decisions at all.  
You can't depend on highly skilled and too smar, big-ticket people. they will come with too much power and when they leave it's hard to replace them.  
Effective and automated systems for low skilled workers is the answer and the key to your freedom.

### Chapter 16: your people strategy

You can't ge people to do what you want, but you can create an environment where doing is more important than not doing it.  
If you want to have great people working for you, You got to become a great man first.

### Chapter 17: Your marketing marketing strategy

You should learn your market demographics(science telling you who buys) and psycho-graphics(the science of perceived marketplace reality, why they buy something).  
How do you find out?
Ask them and give them freebies for their answers. Ask them their favorite colors, perfume, brands. And see how those brands advertise.

### Chapter 18: your systems strategy

Make sure that all the systems work well together and you are set.

### real-life applications

Don't just work the work, think how you can automate the work and replace yourself with a system that does not always need you.  
Then you will be free.
